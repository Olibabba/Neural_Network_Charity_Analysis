# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I'll use the features in a provided dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

I will use a deep learning neural network to create a classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful. My goal is to make a model that achieves at least 75% accuracy. So if my initial model does not meet this requirement I will then find ways to optimize the model in order to reach that goal.
